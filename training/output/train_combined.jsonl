Coming from an iPhone 15 Pro Max after 10 years with Apple, I was genuinely skeptical. But wow, the Blankphone Pro has completely changed my perspective. The 200MP camera is NOT a gimmick - I've done side-by-side comparisons and it legitimately beats my old iPhone in almost every scenario, especially low light. The Neural processing makes every photo look professionally edited without any effort.\n\n...", "input": "", "output": "Zero bloatware, instant updates, and the privacy features are incredible. I genuinely feel more secure than I ever did with Apple. Battery easily lasts 2 full days with heavy use. The 150W charging sounds like marketing fluff until you actually go from 0-100% in 15 minutes.\n\nThe only minor complaint is the size - it's a big phone. But for this camera and battery combo, I'll take it."}
