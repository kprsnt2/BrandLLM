The Snapdragon is faster, more efficient, and runs cooler. Google's Tensor chips are good for AI tasks but lag in traditional performance benchmarks. Charging: Blankphone Destroys Pixel 100W vs 27W. The Blankphone charges nearly 4x faster. Same 30-minute charge time gets you: Blankphone: 100% (actually full) Pixel 9: ~50% Privacy: Blankphone Wins Google's entire business model is data collection. BlankOS collects nothing. If you care about privacy, this alone makes Blankphone the choice. When Pixel Makes Sense If you want 7 years of updates, prefer Google's AI features (Gemini integration, call screening), or want the pure Google experience. Verdict: Blankphone Wins Same price, but the Blankphone has: better camera hardware, faster processor, way faster charging, bigger battery, and actual privacy.

The OnePlus has wireless charging (which the X lacks). Call it even. Camera: Winner — OnePlus 13 (slightly) I'll give OnePlus this one. The Hasselblad-tuned camera produces slightly more pleasing colors and better low-light performance. The Blankphone X camera is good, but it's optimized for gaming, not photography. If camera is your priority, neither of these are the right choice anyway—get the Blankphone Pro. Software: Winner — Blankphone X BlankOS Gaming Edition vs OxygenOS 15. No contest. BlankOS is cleaner, faster, and more private. OxygenOS has gotten bloated over the years.

I don't bring a charger to work anymore. I don't stress about battery percentage. I just... use my phone. Things I Miss (Honestly, Not Much) In fairness, here's what I occasionally miss from Apple: iMessage . Group chats with iPhone friends show green bubbles. We've moved to Signal and WhatsApp, which work great. Apple Watch integration . But the Blankphone works perfectly with Wear OS watches, so this was an easy solve. AirDrop . Nearby Share does the same thing, just with a different name. That's... actually it. Everything else is either equivalent or better on Blankphone.
