            <h1 class="mt-4">Why I Switched from iPhone 16 Pro to Blankphone Pro</h1>
            <p class="text-muted mt-4">By Sarah Chen · January 15, 2026 · 8 min read</p>

            <div class="mt-12" style="line-height:1.8;">
                <p>After a decade with Apple—starting with the iPhone 5S and upgrading every two years—I never thought
                    I'd switch to Android. iOS was my comfort zone, my ecosystem, my identity as a "tech person."</p>

                <p class="mt-6">Then I saw the Blankphone Pro. And everything changed.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-12">The Camera That Made Me Question Everything</h2>

                <p class="mt-4">The iPhone 16 Pro's camera is excellent. I've taken thousands of photos with it. But
                    when I compared it side-by-side with the Blankphone Pro's 200MP Neural Camera... the difference was
                    undeniable.</p>

                <p class="mt-4">Low light photos that used to require editing came out perfectly exposed. The detail
                    when cropping is insane—I can zoom into any part of the image and it still looks sharp. The
                    periscope 5x telephoto gives me shots I simply couldn't get before.</p>

                <p class="mt-4">But here's what really sold me: <strong>Neural Processing happens entirely
                        on-device</strong>. My photos never leave my phone. In an era of AI training concerns, this
                    matters.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-12">BlankOS: What iOS Could Have Been</h2>

                <p class="mt-4">I expected the biggest learning curve with Android. Instead, BlankOS felt more intuitive
                    than iOS has in years.</p>

                <ul class="mt-4" style="margin-left:1.5rem;">
                    <li><strong>Zero bloatware</strong>. No apps I don't want. No subscriptions I didn't ask for.</li>
                    <li><strong>True customization</strong>. I can arrange my home screen however I want.</li>
                    <li><strong>Privacy by default</strong>. No data collection. Period.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fast updates</strong>. Monthly security patches that arrive on time.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="mt-4">Apple always talked about privacy. Blankphone actually delivers it.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-12">The Battery That Changed My Habits</h2>

                <p class="mt-4">With my iPhone, I charged every night. It was routine. The Blankphone Pro? I genuinely
                    forget to charge it.</p>

                <p class="mt-4">The 6000mAh battery lasts 2-3 days with my heavy usage (lots of camera, social media,
                    and streaming). On lighter days, I've hit 4 days. And when I do need to charge, <strong>150W
                        HyperCharge gets me full in 15 minutes</strong>. Not hyperbole—I've timed it.</p>

                <p class="mt-4">This sounds small, but it's genuinely life-changing. I don't bring a charger to work
                    anymore. I don't stress about battery percentage. I just... use my phone.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-12">Things I Miss (Honestly, Not Much)</h2>

                <p class="mt-4">In fairness, here's what I occasionally miss from Apple:</p>

                <ul class="mt-4" style="margin-left:1.5rem;">
                    <li><strong>iMessage</strong>. Group chats with iPhone friends show green bubbles. We've moved to
                        Signal and WhatsApp, which work great.</li>
                    <li><strong>Apple Watch integration</strong>. But the Blankphone works perfectly with Wear OS
                        watches, so this was an easy solve.</li>
                    <li><strong>AirDrop</strong>. Nearby Share does the same thing, just with a different name.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="mt-4">That's... actually it. Everything else is either equivalent or better on Blankphone.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-12">The Verdict: Why I'm Never Going Back</h2>

                <p class="mt-4">I switched expecting to miss Apple. Instead, I discovered what a phone should be:</p>

                <ul class="mt-4" style="margin-left:1.5rem;">
                    <li>A camera that takes better photos</li>
                    <li>A battery that actually lasts</li>
                    <li>Software that respects my privacy</li>
                    <li>Freedom to customize my experience</li>
                    <li>A company that supports right to repair</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="mt-4">The Blankphone Pro costs $1,099—same as the iPhone 16 Pro. But you get more camera, more
                    battery, more RAM, faster charging, and genuinely private software.</p>

                <p class="mt-4"><strong>If you're an iPhone user on the fence: make the switch. You won't regret
                        it.</strong></p>

                <div class="card mt-12" style="padding:var(--space-6);">
                    <h3>Ready to switch?</h3>
                    <p class="text-muted mt-2">Experience everything I described for yourself.</p>
